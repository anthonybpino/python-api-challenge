### Weatherpy notebook grabs city data from random longitudes and latitudes via citipy, organizes them, then plots relationships between latitudes and weather.
Unsurprisingly, temperatures increase the closer you get to the equator

### Vacationpy notebook uses the data from Weatherpy, filters the cities into my ideal temperature range, and finds the nearest hotel to those cities.
Data is presented on maps via hvplot. Hovering over cities shows latitude, longitude, city, country, and nearest hotel.
